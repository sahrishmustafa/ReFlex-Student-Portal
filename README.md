# ReFlex-Student-Portal

## Overview
Welcome to the **Student Portal** repository. This project aims to develop a web-based platform for university students to manage their academic activities efficiently. The portal will provide functionalities such as course registration, grade tracking, document submission, and communication with faculty members.

## Project Status
This repository is currently in the **planning phase**. Development will begin once the sprints are initiated.

## Features (Planned)
- User Authentication (Student, Faculty, Admin)
- Course Registration & Withdrawal
- Viewing Course List & Schedule
- Assignment Submission & Feedback
- Grade & Transcript Viewing
- Attendance Tracking
- Exam Scheduling & Results

## Project Structure (To Be Defined)
The repository will follow a structured approach:
- `/backend/` - Server-side code (APIs, Database, Business Logic)
- `/frontend/` - UI and UX implementation
- `/docs/` - Documentation and meeting notes
- `/tests/` - Automated tests and testing scripts

Note: The repository structure mentioned above may change in each sprint.

## Development Workflow
We are following an **Agile Scrum** methodology. The project will be divided into multiple sprints, with each sprint delivering a set of features.

### Version Control
- Feature branches will be used for development.
- All code will be reviewed before merging into the main branch.
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive.
